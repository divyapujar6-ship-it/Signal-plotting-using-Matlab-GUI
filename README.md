SIGNAL-PLOTTING-USING-MATLAB-GUI
In this project, I have implemented a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) to plot and analyze different types of signals. The GUI allows interactive generation and visualization of signals, making it easier to study their characteristics without manually coding each plot in the MATLAB command window.I have plotted four different types of signals, including:
1. Sine Signal – Generated using the built-in sin() function in MATLAB
2. Square Signal – Created using the square() function in MATLAB. Square waves are non-sinusoidal periodic signals with two distinct amplitude levels
3. Triangular Signal – Generated using the sawtooth() function with a 50% duty cycle. Triangular waves have a linear rise and fall pattern
4. Composite Signal – Obtained by adding multiple signals together, for example, combining sine, square, and triangular waves.
   I have used MATLAB 2016a for developing this project, ensuring compatibility with older systems while still leveraging powerful plotting and GUI-building capabilities.
